# PacMen-Exercise
PacMen-Exercise is a program that creates multiple PacMen on your web browser via button clicks. First button adds multiple PacMen to the screen. Second button starts the game, and it has the PacMen start moving across the screen. Screen bounces will happen and will increase velocity over time. Clicking on the second button any amount of time will increase the speed.

How to run:
1) Clone/download the files onto your computer.
2) Double click on index.html

Roadmap for future improvements:
1) Potentially add ghosts to the screen
2) Potentially add power pellets to the screen
